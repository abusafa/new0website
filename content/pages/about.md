title: About This Project
intro: This site demonstrates how Decap CMS can power a statically generated Next.js application.
---

### Why this starter exists

Publishing content with git enables reviewable, repeatable changes without managing a separate database. Decap CMS provides a friendly editing UI that writes structured markdown into the repository so Next.js can build pages at compile time.

### What's included

- Tailwind CSS for quick styling
- Markdown content collection for static pages
- Blog collection ready for additional posts

Explore the repository to see how content is fetched and rendered, then customize it to fit your project's needs.
