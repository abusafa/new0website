## Welcome

This starter combines Next.js with a git-based CMS so you can publish content-backed pages without leaving your browser.

- Update hero copy directly from the CMS
- Manage site pages and blog posts in one place
- Publish via git or the optional local backend for quick previews

Get started by editing this page in `/admin` or by opening the markdown file under `content/pages/home.md`.
