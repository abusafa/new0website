Welcome to your new content workflow. Blog entries live under `content/blog/en` and can be created, edited, and published directly from the CMS.

```
npm run dev
```

Start the dev server and visit `/admin` to authenticate. Switch to the **Local Back End** if you want to test editing without connecting to a git provider.
